# Godot HeightBlend Node
This is a visual shader addon for Godot 4.2+. This adds the HeightBlend node to the visual shader editor.
This node lets you blend between two heightmaps or use a single heightmap with a mask.

You can blend between two heightmaps. In first example below, the first heightmap is a rock and the second one is dirt. Using the `Height Offset` parameter you can place the dirt in the crevices of the rock. You can mask the blended texture, as seen in the second example.

You can use a single heightmap. In this case you want to leave the Height 2 value at 0.5.

You can adjust the `Contrast` and `Height Offset` parameters to get desired results.

# Installation

Extract the zip file and copy the folder to your project. You'll need to restart the editor for the node to appear in visual shader.
Alternatively, you can make a new gdscript file and copy the code.
